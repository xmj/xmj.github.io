Big Data Frameworks
===================

One of the most curious results I've noticed in the last two years:

Frameworks that exist to supposedly make big amounts of data handling "easier"
on average fail horribly, all in the same ways.

When used outside of narrowly-defined means of the user interface (point &
click), they obscure so many relevant details you will spend 3/4th of your time
trying to navigate their ill-documented APIs - when all they allow you to do is
changing a file on a file system, which can be done by a junior sysadmin in an
instant.

This is, of course, fine and dandy if you are working in a body-leasing
sweatshop and get billed out to clients by the hour (or day) receiving a fixed
salary, because obviously you will want to learn myriad new ways of changing
files in the cloud, all on a customer's dime, so you can list experience with
the latest and greatest frameworks among customer's testimonials and in your
resume.

Whereas, if you were self-employed, billing by terabytes processed per hour,
you'd want to go the "extra mile", and eliminate extant fragility, one source
at a time, until there's almost nothing left.

You would probably set up a highly repeatable cluster installation using very
dumb tools (Perl 5.x, Bourne Shell, maybe Python) on bare metal, and focus on
the underlying software; never the framework to manage it.

Incentives matter.
