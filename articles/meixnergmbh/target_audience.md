Meixner GmbH Target Audience
============================

Primary target audience for the firm Meixner GmbH will be innovative startups in the Big Data, Machine Learning and Automation spaces, established small to medium-sized enterprises lacking skunk-works departments, and large corporations looking to achieve insights into new ways of building out infrastructure through prototypes.

What I aim to deliver are prototypes that demonstrate proofs of concept of client requirements, well-documented and with instructions for deployment in client-owned infrastructure. The focus on prototyping requires understanding two fundamental truths: 1. most prototypes never make it to production 2. if and once they do, the productive infrastructure might share only a tiny fraction with the prototype.

Much like in art, a sketch and a finished picture share only 'broad strokes'.
