# Consulting

Profitable firms like yours may want to access industry experience on strategic
initiatives.

I have worked extensively with mid-large enterprises on a variety of change
cycles and helped senior management design and implement changes to existing
business activities.

In previous engagements, I have noticed that the optimal project engagement
duration is between three and six months. I have found that this timeframe
allows me to obtain an in-depth understanding of your needs, and to create
deliverables required for their execution.

Primary interests:
* Renewal of legacy systems to State of the Art infrastructure
* Reorganization of Big Data pools
* Migrating On-Premise Platforms into the Cloud
