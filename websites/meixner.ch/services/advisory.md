# Advisory

Successful startups like yours occasionally want to obtain outside perspective
to enhance growth beyond current capabilities.

My experience relates to challenging technical founders to go beyond local
maxima, and deliver scalable infrastructure that is consistent with your growth
patterns.

In exchange for a small equity stake, you retain my _via negativa_ pool of experiences
obtained through many past and current startup engagements, my open source
intelligence focusing on solving technical challenges, and a multi-year
commitment.

Primary interests:
* Consistent scaling of frontend, backend and data storage
* Process improvement towards fully automated continuous integration and deployments
* Rethinking infrastructure as you scale

Get in touch to see how I can help your growth story.
