In times of project delivery deadlines, your firm may run into additional
staffing needs that cannot be satisfied internally. To satisfy your internal
and external stakeholders, you want to tap external resources that integrate
into your project management workflows. 

Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to deliver projects that were
augmented with excellent external resources. Through industry partners, I help
you find the right personnel to satisfy your staffing needs.
